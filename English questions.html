    <h1>Think as you read : Solutions of Questions on Page 
        Number : 27</h1><br>
    <p class="que">Question:
        What is the "misadventure" that William Douglas speaks 
        about?</p><br>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>
            Douglas refers to the incident at the Y.M.C.A. swimming 
            pool where he almost drowned as a "misadventure."
            The author was about ten or eleven years old at the time 
            and had barely begun to learn swimming, primarily by
            aping others. As he was thrown suddenly into the water 
            by someone and he couldn't swim, he started drowning.
            The struggle to come to surface and to avoid getting 
            drowned left him with a deep fear of water which 
            deprived him from enjoying water-related activities for 
            many years.</p><br>
        <p class="que">Question:
            What were the series of emotions and fears that Douglas 
            experienced when he was thrown into the pool?
            What plans did he make to come to the surface?</p><br>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>
            The sudden realization of being thrown into the pool did 
            not make him lose his wits immediately. Although
            frightened, he thought of a trick to come up to the surface 
            but couldn't execute it successfully. He panicked and
            felt suffocated by the water. His sense-perceptions gave 
            way, his heart pounded loudly, his limbs became
            paralyzed with fear, his mind became dizzy and his lungs 
            ached as he gulped water while making desperate
            attempts to come out of the water. Finally, he lost all his 
            strength and willingness to keep struggling and
            blacked out. <br>
            Douglas planned to allow himself to go down till his feet 
            hit the bottom so that could make a big jump to come
            back to the surface like a cork. Then, he would lie flat on 
            the surface of water and paddle to the edge of the
            pool.</p><br>
        <p class="que">Question:
            How did this experience affect him?</p><br>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>
            The near death experience of drowning had a very strong 
            impact on his psychology. He was deeply perturbed 
            emotional balance for many years. As he couldn't bear 
            being surrounded by water, he was deprived of enjoying
            any water-related activity.</p><br>
            <h1>Think as you read : Solutions of Questions on Page 
                Number : 29</h1><br>
        <p class="que">Question:
            Why was Douglas determined to get over his fear of 
            water?</p><br>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>
            Douglas regretted being deprived of enjoying water 
            activities like canoeing, boating, swimming, fishing, etc.
            The wish to enjoy them and the craving to regain his lost 
            confidence, while being in water, made him try every
            possible way to get rid of his fear. He was finally able to 
            overcome this mental handicap by getting himself a
            swimming instructor and further ensuring that no residual 
            fear was left.</p><br>
        <p class="que">Question:
            How did the instructor "build a swimmer" out of 
            Douglas?</p><br>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>
            The instructor worked gradually on Douglas' psychology, 
            moved on to his physical movements and then integrated 
            each part to build a swimmer out of him.
            Initially, he made Douglas swim back and forth across the 
            swimming pool so that he could get used to it. He
            used an elaborate mechanism with a rope, belt, pulley and 
            an overhead cable to help them stay connected while
            Douglas was in the pool. Then, one- by-one, he made 
            Douglas master the individual techniques of swimming,
            like putting his head in the water, exhaling and inhaling 
            while in water, movements of his hands, body, legs, etc.
            Finally, he integrated these perfected steps into a whole 
            experience of swimming for Douglas.
            </p><br>
        <p class="que">Question:
            How did Douglas make sure that he conquered the old 
            terror?</p><br>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>
            Even after the swimming training was over, Douglas 
            wasn't confident about his swimming or that he had
            overcome the fear. He was determined to completely get 
            rid of it forever. He swam alone in the pool. He went
            to Lake Wentworth to dive. There, he tried every possible 
            stroke he had learnt. He fought back the tiny vestiges
            of terror that gripped him in middle of the lake. Finally, in 
            his diving expedition in the Warm Lake, he realised
            that he had truly conquered his old terror.</p><br>

            Questions on Page Number : 29</h1><br>
        <p class="que">Question:
            How does Douglas make clear to the reader the sense of 
            panic that gripped him as he almost drowned?
            Describe the details that have made the description vivid.</p><br>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>
            Douglas takes us through his near death experience at the 
            Y.M.C.A. pool by detailing every little aspect associated 
            to it. He details minutes of his emotional, mental and 
            physical struggle with the paralyzing fear of being 
            drowned in the water. The first person narration of the 
            incident also helps us to associate with his experience 
            more deeply.<br>
            Though he did not lose his wits initially, he panicked 
            when his strategy didn't work. His feeling of suffocation,
            fear and losing hold on sense perceptions make the 
            readers experience what he does. His eyes couldn't see
            beyond the dirty yellow water. His voice did not assist 
            him. His nose and mouth could only manage to take
            water to the lungs. His limbs became paralyzed with fear 
            and his mind dizzy. His desperation to save himself
            kept him struggling until he went down the third time and 
            blacked out. All these details make the description
            vivid.
            </p><br>
        <p class="que">Question:
            How did Douglas overcome his fear of water?</p><br>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>
            At first, he tried to overcome his fear of water on his own. 
            But when this failed, he got an instructor for himself
            who worked on Douglas' fear very methodically. With his 
            help, Douglas began by learning to be at ease in water. 
            After this, he practiced exhaling- inhaling in water to 
            eliminate the fear of putting his head inside the water. 
            Then, he moved on to master individual steps of 
            swimming which were, finally, integrated into a
            complete experience of swimming, by his instructor. 
            After about six months, Douglas could not only swim 
            well but was, also, free of his fear to a great extent.
            At this stage, Douglas' journey of truly overcoming his 
            fear to its tiniest vestiges began. He swam alone in the
            pool. He went to Lake Wentworth to dive. He tried every 
            possible stroke he learnt. Finally, in his diving expedition, 
            in the Warm Lake, he conquered his fear completely.</p><br>
        <p class="que">Question:
            Why does Douglas as an adult recount a childhood 
            experience of terror and his conquering of it? What
            larger meaning does he draw from his experience?</p><br>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>
            Douglas recounts his childhood experience at the 
            Y.M.C.A. pool to enable the readers to understand the 
            exact nature and intensity of the terror. The fear of being 
            surrounded by the water, the fear of putting his head in 
            the water, the fear of choking and the fear of his limbs 
            going numb couldn't have been explained to a reader
            unacquainted with Douglas' childhood experience. In that 
            case, the elaborate strategy adopted by the author
            (and his instructor) and the time-taken by him to learn or 
            master even simple things, though put in the
            perspective of his fear of water, couldn't have been 
            understood properly.<br>
            By quoting Roosevelt, "All we have to fear is fear itself," 
            Douglas indicates the larger meaning that he draws
            from his experience. For him, the importance of life 
            became evident when he encountered death or rather its
            proximity threatening his life.</p><br>

        <p class="que">Question:
            "All we have to fear is fear itself". Have you ever had a 
            fear that you have now overcome? Share your
            experience with your partner.</p><br>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>
            Directions: Everyone has some or other fear that has 
            been overcome. Think about one such experience from
            your life. It may be anything associated to activities that 
            you now engage in with ease but were scared earlier.
            Driving, skating, public-speaking, participating in a 
            competition or overcoming stage fear are some examples.
            After you have found one such example from your life, 
            recollect the reason it bothered or frightened you.
            Recollect the efforts you and/or other people put in to 
            help you get rid of it. Discuss the detailed experience
            with your partner in the class. Also, discuss your feelings 
            when you realised that you have overcome the fear
            entirely.<br>
            (Guidelines/directions have been provided for students' 
            reference. It is strongly recommended that students
            prepare the answer on their own.)</p><br>
        <p class="que">Question:
            Find and narrate other stories about conquest of fear and 
            what people have said about courage. For example, you 
            can recall Nelson Mandela's struggle for freedom, his 
            perseverance to achieve his mission, to liberate the 
            oppressed and the oppressor as depicted in his 
            autobiography. The story We're Not Afraid to Die, which 
            you have read in Class IX, is an apt example of how 
            courage and optimism helped a family survive under the 
            direst stress.</p><br>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>
            Hrithik Roshan - one of the highest paid and greatly 
            admired actor suffered from stammering - used to bunk
            school during oral exams - was skinny - couldn't dance 
            well - decided to establish well in his career and get rid
            of negatives - took speech therapy every day - worked as 
            assistant director - training at the gym for hours - 
            practiced dancing - after years of patience and 
            perseverance, he is now one of the most admired actor 
            and dancer.<br>
            (Pointers have been provided for students' reference. It is 
            strongly recommended that students prepare the answer 
            on their own.)</p><br>
            <p class="que">Question:
                If someone else had narrated Douglas' experience, how 
                would it have differed from this account? Write
                out a sample paragraph or paragraphs from this text from 
                the point of view of a third person or observer
                to find out which style of narration would you consider to 
                be more effective? Why?</p><br>
            <p><b>Answer :</b>
                If a third person had narrated Douglas' experience, the 
                impact of the story would have lost the reader's deep
                connection with the main protagonist and his fear of 
                water. The narrator then would be passively telling the
                story from the perspective of an observer. The incident of 
                drowning in water could never have successfully
                communicated the feeling of the "stark terror" that 
                Douglas underwent. In third person narrative, the 8th and 
                9th paragraph of the story would be as follows:
                "He flailed at the surface of the water, swallowed and 
                choked. He tried to bring his legs up but they hung as
                dead weights, paralyzed and rigid. A great force was 
                pulling him under. He screamed, but only the water heard
                him. He had started on the long journey back to the 
                bottom of the pool." "He struck at the water as he went 
                down; expending his strength as one in a nightmare, fights 
                an irresistible force. He had lost all his breath. His lungs 
                ached. His head throbbed. He was getting dizzy. But he 
                remembered the strategy - he would spring from the 
                bottom of the pool and come like a cork to the surface. He 
                would lie flat on the water, strike out with his arms, and 
                thrash with his legs. Then he would get to the edge of the 
                pool and be safe."<br>
                So, it is only the first person narrative that keeps the 
                reader gripped to the story. It makes the experience more
                relevant and tangible for the reader. It engages him by 
                making him go through the experience along with the
                protagonist. The desperation and helplessness of being in 
                water, which has almost become fatal, the mental and
                physical agony of trying to survive the crisis, the long 
                struggle of overcoming the fear bit-by-bit and the
                jubilation of conquering it at the end; all make the reader 
                feel part of the experience. The first person narrative
                makes the story a fast-paced and urgent reading for the 
                readers. All this would have been lost had it been a third
                person narrative or from the point of view of an observer.</p><br>
